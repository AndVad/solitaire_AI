# solitaire_AI
This project was taken on in my freetime to practice ML and AI concepts outside of the classroom.  The idea is to create an agent that can play Solitaire, then train it to play well under vegas-scoring rules.  Finally, we'll print out a move directory, such that the optimal move from every environment is known.
I may perhaps mess around with what learning theories I'm using, and compare if the final results are the same, or if one converges faster than another.
I will be using python 3, and importing numpy and pandas to help with the data manipulation.
